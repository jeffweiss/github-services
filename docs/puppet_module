PuppetModule
============

Puppet Labs maintains a marketplace for Puppet modules, the Forge. Integrating your GitHub repository with the Forge makes it easy to publish new versions of your Puppet modules.  When a new version tag is pushed to GitHub, the PuppetModule service hook will notify the Forge of the new tag, initiating the auto-publishing process.
